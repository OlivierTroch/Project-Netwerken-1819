# Vagrant environment with shell provisioning

Scaffolding code for a multi-VM Vagrant environment with shell provisioning. It is based on my reusable "[One Vagrantfile to rule them all](https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/10/05/one-vagrantfile-to-rule-them-all/)" (I gave a [lightning talk about this](https://youtu.be/qJ0VNO6z68M) at [Config Management Camp 2016 Ghent](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) - [slides here](http://www.slideshare.net/bertvanvreckem/one-vagrantfile-to-rule-them-all)). Hosts are defined in a simple Yaml format (see below), so setting up a multi-VM environment becomes almost trivial.

For a more advanced Vagrant setup with Ansible provisioning, see this project's big brother, [ansible-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-skeleton).

If you like/use this project, please consider giving it a star. Thanks!

## Getting started

### TL;DR

The short version... After forking and cloning, add VMs in `vagrant-hosts.yml`, e.g.:

```Yaml
# vagrant-hosts.yml
---
- name: srv001
  ip: 192.168.56.31
```

and write a provisioning script with the same name as the VM in the `provisioning/` folder (e.g. `provisioning/srv001.sh`).

### Fork & clone

First of all, fork this project and give it a suitable name. Then, clone it locally.

**A warning to Windows users**: make sure you set `core.autocrlf` to `input`.

```
git clone --config core.autocrlf=input git@github.com:USER/PROJECTNAME.git
```

If you don't, the provisioning scripts will get [DOS line endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Common_problems) and won't run inside the VMs. You will get an error like this one:

```
$ vagrant provision
==> srv001: Running provisioner: shell...
    srv001: Running: /tmp/vagrant-shell20170315-6275-78kw7v.sh
==> srv001: /vagrant/provisioning//util.sh: line 4: $'\r': command not found
The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant
assumes that this means the command failed. The output for this command
should be in the log above. Please read the output to determine what
went wrong.
```

### Choose default base box

Modify the [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) to select your favourite base box. I use a [CentOS 7 base box](https://github.com/bertvv/boxcutter-centos), based on [Mischa Taylor's Packer template](https://github.com/boxcutter/centos). This is probably the only time you need to edit the `Vagrantfile`.

```Ruby
# Set your default base box here
DEFAULT_BASE_BOX = 'bertvv/centos72'
```

### Specify VMs

Next, edit `vagrant-hosts.yml` to specify the VMs in your Vagrant environment. Currently, it contains:

```Yaml
- name: srv001
  ip: 192.168.56.31
```

The `vagrant-hosts.yml` file specifies the nodes that are controlled by Vagrant. You should at least specify a `name:`, other settings (see below) are optional. A host-only adapter is created and the given IP assigned to that interface. Other optional settings that can be specified:

- `ip:` The IP address for the VM.
- `netmask`: By default, the network mask is `255.255.255.0`. If you want another one, it should be specified.
- `mac`: The MAC address to be assigned to the NIC. Several notations are accepted, including "Linux-style" (`00:11:22:33:44:55`) and "Windows-style" (`00-11-22-33-44-55`). The separator characters can be omitted altogether (`001122334455`).
- `intnet`: If set to `true`, the network interface will be attached to an internal network rather than a host-only adapter.
- `auto_config`: If set to `false`, Vagrant will not attempt to configure the network interface.
- `synced_folders`: A list of dicts that specify synced folders. Two keys, `src` (the directory on the host system) and `dest` (the mount point in the guest) are mandatory, another one, `options` is, well, optional. The possible options are the same ones as specified in the [Vagrant documentation on synced folders](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html). One caveat is that the option names should be prefixed with a colon, e.g. `owner:` becomes `:owner:`.
- `box`: Choose another base box instead of the default one specified in Vagrantfile. A box name in the form `USER/BOX` (e.g. `bertvv/centos72`) is fetched from [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search).
- `box_url`: Download the box from the specified URL instead of from Atlas.

You can add hosts to the environment by adding entries to the `vagrant-hosts.yml` file. An example:

```Yaml
- name: srv001
  ip: 192.168.56.31
- name: srv002
  ip: 192.168.56.32
  box: bertvv/fedora25
- name: srv003
  ip: 192.168.56.33
  synced_folders:
    - src: test
      dest: /tmp/test
    - src: www
      dest: /var/www/html
      options:
        :create: true
        :owner: root
        :group: root
        :mount_options: ['dmode=0755', 'fmode=0644']
```

### Provisioning

For each host you defined, you should add a shell script to the `provisioning/` directory with the same name as the VM, e.g. [srv001.sh](provisioning/srv001.sh). The directory now also contains two other scripts:

- [util.sh](provisioning/util.sh), which contains Bash functions that you can use in your provisioning scripts
- [common.sh](provisioning/common.sh), which contains provisioning tasks that are common to all VMs in your Vagrant environment.

Host-specific provisioning scripts should source both files.
