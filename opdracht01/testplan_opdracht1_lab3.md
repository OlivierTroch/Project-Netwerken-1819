# Testplan Opdracht 1 - Lab 3

## Part 1
In this part we will make sure that the initial topology is done correctly in Packet Tracer

### Packet Tracer
Verify that the PC's IP addresses are configured correctly according to the adressing table of the exercise:  



## Part 2
### Step 1
In the following section the router has to be configured according to the cisco standard. Verify that everything has been secured: "class" as privileged EXEC encrypted password; and "cisco" for the VTY lines and console password with login enabled.  
"show running-config" would be a big help for this.

### Step 2
Check if the router interfaces are correctly configured according to the addressing table.

### Step 3
Check the connection by pinging from PC-A to PC-B and vice versa. Make sure your firewall settings are set correctly.

### Step 4
Verify the answer given to question n).


## Part 3
### Step 1
Here we need to verify some informational data of the router and switch.
Assure that every answer has been filled in correctly by using the "show version" command on both router and switch and checking the outputs for both.

### Step 2
Lastly check the answers given to Step 2, 3 and 4 in the exercise.  
Make sure the answers are logical and correct.

## Reflection
Configuration was completely done via the Cisco Packet Tracer software.
